 ArduinoISP2 
 March 2012 William Phelps - wm (at) usa.net 
 
 This is a fork of Adafruit's ArduinoISP
 
 modified for Arduino IDE 1.0 which has a shorter serial port receive buffer
 getEOP() now gets entire request before avrisp() is called to process it
 Serial.print((char) xxx) changed to Serial.write(xxx)
 uint8_t changed to byte
 added support for Piezo speaker
 moved Pmode LED to A0
 removed "heartbeat" on pin 6, added short blip of ERROR LED instead 
 Why is it that PROG_FLASH and PROG_DATA don't actually do anything???
 Tested with Arduino IDE 22 and 1.0
 IDE 22 - 5148 bytes
 IDE 1.0 - 5524 bytes!
